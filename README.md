This is a simple program with a GUI that has a few separate features sepparated by tab.
1.  Binary Decoder:  This tab allows a user to manually type out 7 or 8 bit binary code which can then be decoded into is          ACII value or the user can import a file of 7 or 8 bit SCII code to be interpreted.
2.  Vigenere Cipher:  This tab utilizes a Vigenere cipher (Each lettter in a message is encoded or decoded determined by
         an offsett created by a key which is repeated for the encoding/decoding of message).  This tab enables a user to 
         manually enter, copy and paste, or import a .txt file to be decoded.  The user also has the ability to encode 
         their own messages.
3. Covert Message:  This tab of the program allows a user to input the login information to an ftp server, The program then 
         searches through a specified folder for encrypted messages in either 8 or 10 bit code hidden in the permissions of 
         the files of that directory.
4. Chat Timing:  This tab allows a user to connect to a server to receive an overt-message.  Based on the time intervals 
         that the overt message is received, a covert message can be deciphered if subplanted in the overt message.
